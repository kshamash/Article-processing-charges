This is an analysis of Jisc's APC data for 2013-2016. 

jisc.mplstyle is a custom Matplotlib style for creating Jisc themed visualizations.

The PNG and SVG folders contain the visualizations generated. 

The Data folder contains the data used. Some institutions asked that their data not be shared, so the data set has these removed.
